## Methods Repository navigation:  
- Because our lab spans a broad range of approaches to studying how populations are changing on a changing planet, we have separate repositories to represent each method.  As new projects evolve, new folders are added to those repositories (see [laboratory](https://github.com/pinskylab/laboratory) as an example).

### [field](https://github.com/pinskylab/field)

Holds protocols and scripts used in the field. It also contains data
from the temperature loggers and GPS data. Maps are made using the
repository [Phils\_GIS\_R](https://github.com/pinskylab/Phils_GIS_R).

### [genomics](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics)

This folder contains subfolders and guides to help lab members working
with bioinformatics.  
- [A guide to how we used ABC with SNPs for summer flounder](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/manuals/Guide%20to%20performing%20ABC%20using%20SNP%20data.md).  
- [A guide to getting started on the amarel cluster](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/manuals/Guide%20to%20using%20the%20Amarel%20cluster.md)
- [A guide to submitting sequencing data to the NCBI SRA](https://github.com/pinskylab/SRA-submission/blob/master/Guide%20to%20NCBI%20SRA.md)

### [species distribution modeling](https://github.com/pinskylab/SDM-convergence)
This repo contains data and scripts to analyze data to study species distributions over time.

### [laboratory](https://github.com/pinskylab/laboratory)

This folder contains subfolders and guides to help lab members working
in the wet laboratory, especially with sequencing library preparation.

### [labmgt](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods/tree/master/labmgt)

This folder contains protocols for general lab management, for example
how to create backups.

### [cookbook.md](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods/blob/master/cookbook.md)

This file gives tips and tricks for how Pinsky Lab Members have overcome
obstacles related to data science. The struggle is real\!
